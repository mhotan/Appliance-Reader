/*
 * Base class of all picture-taker activities.
 * This class is meant to standardize the process so
 * a new implementation would agree to the same pattern.
 * 
 * This class is designed as an independent Activity
 * So a user would invoke it through startActivity()
 * and obtain the path of the picture taken through 
 * the corresponding construct. NOTE that returning the 
 * Bitmap immediately DOESN'T work due to Google's bug?
 * (I wasted some time just to figure this out!!)
 * 
 * The path of the resulting image is returned
 * via an Intent passed through onActivityResult()
 * with key name = "IMAGE_PATH"
 * (eg. intent.getExtras().getString("IMAGE_PATH") )
 *
